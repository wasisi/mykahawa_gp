## Stay On-topic
Be sure your comment matches the general theme of the page you are viewing. 

## Keep it civil
Insults, personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. Sexist, racist, tribal, misogynist, homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of people are simply not allowed. Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing will be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. 

Always strive to add value to every interaction and discussion you participate in
Before joining in a discussion, browse through some of the most recent and active discussions happening in the community, especially if you’re new there. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

## Keep it tidy
Help make moderators’ lives easier by taking a moment to ensure that what you’re about to post is in the right place. That means:
	• don’t post off-topic comments or discussions
	• don’t cross-post the same thing multiple times
	• check if another active discussion on your topic has already been posted
	• TRY NOT TO USE all caps. 

## If you see something, say something
Moderators are at the forefront of combatting spam, mediating disputes and enforcing community guidelines and, so are you. If you see an issue, contact the moderators if possible or flag any comments for review. If you believe someone has violated the Basic Rules, report it to Disqus by flagging the user's profile.

## Don’t plagiarize
Plagiarism is bad. Don't do it.

## English and Kiswahili only
We currently only support English and Kiswahili discussions. Non-English or Non-Kiswahili comments and discussions will be removed.
