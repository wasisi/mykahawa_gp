The Platform faces unique challenges in preserving biodiversity, which is nothing less than the foundation of existence. Concrete recommendations and the first work programme were urgently needed from IPBES in order to place biodiversity at the top of the international political agenda and raise public awareness of the issue. She noted Germany remains actively engaged and would continue to support the work of the secretariat with an annual contribution of 1 million euros to the Trust Fund. In addition, it would establish a national IPBES coordination office to keep the scientific community up to date on the work of IPBES and support the secretariat.</span></span></section><section class="akn-subsection" id="part_I__subsec_4" data-eId="part_I__subsec_4"><span class="akn-num">(4)</span><span class="akn-content"><span class="akn-p">Mr. Nimptsch said that it was fitting that the hall where the first Plenary was taking place had been built in the spirit of democracy and freedom for its former use as home of the German Parliament.

He expressed optimism regarding the possibility of linking science to policymaking in future, and highlighted that the first session should mark the end of the design phase of the Platform with an agreement on the next steps towards its initial work programme so that future meetings could be dedicated to scientific and technical work. In closing, he emphasized the spirit of multilateralism which underpinned the United Nations institutions and was essential to the effectiveness of the Platform.

It was proposed by many delegates that the four United Nations organizations should participate in the implementation of the Platform’s work programme. In addition, Governments urged the United Nations organizations to second staff to the IPBES secretariat. Upon a proposal by the Acting Chair, a friends of the chair group to consider the subject was established, which was chaired by Luthando Dziba (South Africa), which considered the matter further.

Considering the fact that the financial procedures of the Platform will need to be aligned with the Rules and procedures to be used for the administration of the trust fund of the Platform by the organization that will be entrusted with such administration, the Plenary decided to further consider and finalize financial procedures for the Platform at its next session on the basis of discussions at its first session.</span></span></section></section><section class="akn-subpart" id="part_VIII__subpart_B" data-eId="part_VIII__subpart_B"><h2>B – Initial budget of the Platform</h2>

Some representatives suggested a step-by-step approach to building the secretariat, responding to the development of the work programme. Many suggested that meetings of subsidiary bodies should be kept to a minimum and that electronic means of communication should be used to the greatest extent possible. However, it was noted that in order to make progress on the development of the initial work programme, two meetings of the Bureau and the Multidisciplinary Expert Panel should be held in 2013. The representatives also welcomed the intention of a secondment by the United Nations Environment Programme, and encouraged the other United Nations organizations to likewise consider such secondments. The secretariat was requested to further elaborate on the proposed budget for 2013 and 2014. An informal group was established under the leadership of Mr. Spencer Thomas (Grenada).
