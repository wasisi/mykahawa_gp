During the survey a glimpse of the farm historical background and how coffee farming is done to attain better yields:The farm was established by the Consolata fathers in 1904 and 1914 they introduced coffee as farming method.

Coffee does well in areas around 1800 above sea level and rainfall yearly 1200 mm but on average they get around 950 mm of rainfall per year,2018 the farm got 1400 mm of rainfall among the highest in recent years but due to the recent weather changes the farm has started installing an irrigation system (A third of the farm has already been installed with drip irrigation system the other two thirds is still under installation). Total land under cultivation 344 hectares, number of trees 398530, 2018-2019 coffee produced was 32,5000 kgs. 

These are the varieties of coffee the farm produces Arabica: Sl-28 82%, Ruiru-11 14% and Batian 2%. They have coffee nurseries. Old coffee tree bushes are usually uprooted after every six years hence allowing the young trees to mature. This process helps to increase in production per coffee tree,thus increases immunity in that the older trees are more prone to diseases and have less yields per branch also as age progresses the less heavier berries. Nyeri Hill Farm and Archdiocese has 90% from the local community hence creating a reliable source of livelihood.

Nyeri Hill Farm and Archdiocese of Nyeri's goal is to improve the quality of life of its farm and factories by seeking better prices and higher returns through promoting sustainable, production, processing and marketing technologies.
