          MyKahawa is a business analytics and market intelligence platform that provides greater transparency and visibility into the Kenya Coffee market and industry. 
        </p>

        <h3>Where did MyKahawa get its data from?</h3>
        <p>
        MyKahawa collects, cleans and stores transaction reports from the Nairobi Coffee Exchange at the end of each sale. The Nairobi Coffee Exchange (NCE) is a central coffee auction where an estimated 80% of Kenya's coffee is traded. The NCE is mandated to manage Kenya's central coffee auction. Trading at NCE usually takes place on Tuesdays at Wakulima House, Haile Sellasie Avenue in Nairobi. The data used in this website is made available by the NCE at the end of each sale

        <h3>Can I buy coffee from MyKahawa?</h3>
        <p>
        We are not licensed or involved in the trade in coffee. We can put you in touch with authorized and reliable dealers who can ship coffee to you. 
        </p>

         <h3>Why cant I find information about my cooperative/estate/dealer?</h3>
        <p>
        Reference was made to the Kenya Coffee Directory report produced by the Kenya Coffee Traders Association in 2012. We are maintaining the directory by updating and adding records based on transactions taking place at the Nairobi Coffee Exchange.
