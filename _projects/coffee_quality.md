## Introduction

Quality is determined by the combination of the physical appearance of the green bean and the roasted coffee and more importantly the cup quality after tasting

## Coffee characteristics and processes that affect quality
- Presence or absence of extraneous material like stones or twigs: Drying and cleaning  
- Wrinkled beans: Drying
- Cracking/shrunken and boat shaped beans: Drying
- Nipped or deformed coffee: Pulping
- Overall cup quality (aroma, thickness of the brew, taste, flavour and acidity): Picking, storage, washing, soaking, cleaning, pulping, and fermentation
- Fruity cup: Pulping
- Mustiness or foxy beans: Fermentation
- Foxy beans: Bagging
- Mould (Ochratoxin A): Drying, diseases, and pests
